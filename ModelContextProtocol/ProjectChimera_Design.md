```

- All agents self-register with the MCP Orchestrator on startup.
- The orchestrator exposes a /plan-and-run endpoint for natural language requests.
- The orchestrator delegates tasks to agents based on planning logic.
- LogAnalyzer agent calls the Sanitizer agent directly for data sanitization.
- The orchestrator aggregates results and returns a combined response.

## Orchestration Flow & Communication Strategy

1. **Agent Registration**: Each agent (Sanitizer, LogAnalyzer, ReportGenerator) starts up and registers itself with the orchestrator via a `/register` endpoint, providing its capabilities.
2. **Request Handling**: The orchestrator exposes a `/plan-and-run` endpoint. When it receives a natural language request, it uses a simple rule-based planner to determine which agents to involve and in what order.
3. **Task Delegation**: The orchestrator sends tasks to the appropriate agents. For example, it sends raw logs to the Sanitizer agent, then passes sanitized logs to the LogAnalyzer agent.
4. **Agent-to-Agent Calls**: The LogAnalyzer agent, upon receiving sanitized logs, may call the Sanitizer agent directly if further sanitization is needed.
5. **Aggregation**: The orchestrator collects results from all agents and aggregates them into a single, readable output.

## Scaling, Reliability, and Extensions

- **Scaling**: Each agent and the orchestrator can be independently scaled as microservices. Load balancing and service discovery can be added for production.
- **Reliability**: Agents can implement retry logic and health checks. The orchestrator can track agent status and handle failures gracefully.
- **Extensibility**: New agents can self-register with the orchestrator, making it easy to add new capabilities. The planner can be upgraded to use an LLM or more advanced logic.
- **Real AI Models**: In a real-world scenario, agents could wrap actual AI models or external APIs, and the orchestrator could manage more complex workflows and dependencies.
